# configs

## Alacritty Configs

Those files need to be in ~/.config/alacritty/ or in one of the other places alacritty checks for its config file. Also make sure you change the path of the home directory within the alacritty config.

## Neofetch Config

That will need to be placed in ~/.config/neofetch/


## Fish Config

The fish config relies on [Starship](https://starship.rs/). Please install it before attempting to use that config file. I also use Figlet, which is likely in your repositories, just make sure you have that too and change the text it outputs, or if you don't want it at all; just get rid of it.

Most of my configs use the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) color scheme. Please check them out!
